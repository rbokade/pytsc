## `PyTSC`: Traffic Signal Control Environment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

PyTSC is a Python library for training reinforcement learning (RL) models for traffic signal control (TSC). It lets you simulate traffic scenarios and train agents using different RL/MARL algorithms. You can either **SUMO or CityFlow** simulator. The library is **modular** so *you can modify MDP formulations as per as your need.* PyTSC is **open-source**. You can find it on `GitHub <https://github.com/rbokade/pytsc>`__. Contributions from the community are welcome and appreciated!
