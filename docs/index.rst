PyTSC is a Python library for **traffic signal control and reinforcement learning**. It lets you simulate traffic scenarios and train agents using different MARL algorithms. You can use tools like **SUMO or CityFlow** as the traffic simulator. The library is **modular**. *You can plug in different backends or RL frameworks.* It works well for research on traffic control and multi-agent systems. 

PyTSC is **open-source**. You can find it on `GitHub <https://github.com/rbokade/pytsc>`__.
